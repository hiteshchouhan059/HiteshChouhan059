# 💫 About Me:
I’m an MCA student and Cloud Computing enthusiast who enjoys building things on AWS, Azure, Docker, Terraform, and anything related to automation & scalable architecture. I love experimenting with cloud deployments, solving real infrastructure problems, and turning ideas into hands-on projects.<br>Recently, I completed a STEP Internship at CDW, where I gained exposure to networking, enterprise collaboration systems, and real-world cloud fundamentals. I worked with guided labs, troubleshooting workflows, and documentation to understand how enterprise systems communicate and scale.<br>I’ve deployed cloud-hosted applications, automated pipelines using GitHub Actions, and containerized microservices using Docker. I’m currently preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification while continuing to learn through building real infrastructure projects.<br><br>⭐ What I Love Doing<br>☁️ Cloud Deployments (AWS | Azure)<br>🐳 Docker & Containerization<br>⚙️ Terraform for Infra Automation<br>🚀 CI/CD with GitHub Actions<br>🧠 Learning, experimenting, and breaking things (then fixing them 😄)<br><br>💬 Outside Tech…<br>I enjoy exploring new tools, polishing my problem-solving skills, and sharing what I learn with others. I believe in writing clean deployments, simple architecture, and systems that scale without headaches.<br><br>📫 Let’s Connect<br>If you’re into Cloud, DevOps, or side projects, feel free to connect — always happy to collaborate or chat!<br>
